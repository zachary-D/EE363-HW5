After extracting the files from the hw5.jar archive, the files submitted to moodle should be placed in "hw5files/" (next to the assignment .pdf file).  At this point, 'make Q1Exec' will compile and execute the first problem.
  If you extract the .jar for the second problem (as mentioned in p2README.txt) calling 'make execute' will compile and run both problems.
